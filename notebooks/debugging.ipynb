Introduction</title><p>Obesity is a chronic metabolic nutritional disorder that has increased at an alarming rate in the last 20 years    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>].  In the US, 68% of the adults (age &#x02265; 20 years) and 18% of children (2&#x02013;19 years) are either obese or overweight as per the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>].  Incidence of obesity is associated with many health complications such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>], and a range of lipid abnormalities, the most common being nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>].  </p><p>NAFLD is an important health concern due to its high prevalence (~20% of adult population) and its association with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. It is characterized by hepatic lipid accumulation primarily in the form of triglycerides (TG) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. Some of the potential steps involved in the progression of NAFLD may involve increased uptake of circulating fatty acids (FA) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>], increased hepatic denovo lipogenesis (DNL) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>], reduced rate of FA oxidation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>], or reduced FA secretion    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>].  When NAFLD is associated with inflammation and fibrosis, it is termed as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a serious condition that could lead to liver cirrhosis, hepatic carcinoma, and liver failure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>]. The pathogenesis of NAFLD can be explained by &#x0201c;two hit&#x0201d; hypothesis suggesting steatosis as the &#x0201c;first hit&#x0201d; which increases the vulnerability of liver to various second hits like oxidative stress and inflammation leading to NASH [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>]. </p><p>Although no specific guidelines exist for treatment of NAFLD, recommendations are aimed at reducing body weight due to its strong association with obesity and metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. In this regard, bioactive lipids/FA as functional food may be important in modulating metabolism and body weight. A specific group of polyunsaturated FA collectively known as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) have been suggested to have an effect on regulating energy metabolism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>] and is being used commercially as a weight-loss supplement. CLA were recently granted &#x0201c;Generally Recognized As Safe&#x0201d;, status in the United States (GRN no. 232; <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/\">http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/</ext-link>) for use as a dietary supplement.  However, CLA effects are varied depending on the type of CLA isomer, the animal\\'s physiological condition, and the tissue type examined.  In this paper, we summarize the recent studies on effect of CLA on hepatic lipid metabolism highlighting the potential regulatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"section\" id=\"sec2\"><title>2. Conjugated Linoleic Acid</title><p>Conjugated linoleic acid refers to a group of dienoic derivatives of linoleic acid with conjugated double bonds arranged in different combinations of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> configuration [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. Currently, 16 naturally occurring CLA isomers have been identified with different positional (7/9, 8/10, 9/11, 10/12, and 11/13) and geometric (<italic>cis</italic>/<italic>cis</italic>, <italic>trans</italic>/<italic>trans</italic>, <italic>cis</italic>/<italic>trans</italic>, and <italic>trans</italic>/<italic>cis</italic>) combinations    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>].  </p><p>Sources of CLA include those naturally present in dairy products and meat from ruminant animals or those contained in industrially hydrogenated vegetable oils and other synthetic products [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>].  The CLA originating from the ruminant products predominantly consist of <italic>cis</italic>-9, <italic>trans</italic>-11 CLA (&#x0003e;80%), with a small amounts of <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA and other isomers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The industrially synthesized CLA and other commercial products intended for human consumption typically consists of equal amounts of <italic>cis</italic>-9, <italic>trans</italic>-11 CLA and <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA and other isomers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. Of all the CLA isomers, <italic>cis</italic>-9, <italic>trans</italic>-11 CLA and <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA have been the most widely studied due to their biologically active properties [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"section\" id=\"sec3\"><title>3. Physiological Effects of CLA</title><p>A great deal of current interest in CLA is due to their bioactive properties including anticarcinogenic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>], antiatherogenic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>], immunity enhancing    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>], and effects on  body composition [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>].  Each CLA isomer has unique bioactive properties, and hence, the biological effect from a mixture of dietary CLA isomers, as is the case in most of the studies, would be the combined effect of their distinct isomers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>].  For example, <italic>cis</italic>-9, <italic>trans</italic>-11 CLA and <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA have additive effects on cancer    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] and immune cell functions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] but are antagonistic on insulin sensitivity.  While <italic>cis</italic>-9, <italic>trans</italic>-11 CLA improves insulin sensitivity, <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA causes insulin resistance.  Also, <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA is solely responsible for changes in body composition and reducing adipose mass [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>].</p><sec sec-type=\"subsection\" id=\"sec3.1\"><title>3.1. Body Weight and Lean Mass</title><p>  CLA reduces body weight and body fat mass and increases lean mass in different species [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>].  However, the response appears to vary depending on species, physiological stage, and fat depot    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>].  <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab1\">Table 1</xref> provides a summary of studies reviewed across species with respect to body weight and adiposity, where the number of experiments showing significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) increases, decreases, or no change and the mean response to dietary <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA within those categories are reported. The range of <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA addition in these studies varied between 0.1 and 1 percent of the diet.</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<italic>Trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA reduces body fat to a maximum extent in mice (60% to 80%)    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>]. However, modest and inconsistent effects are seen in rats    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">49</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">82</xref>], hamsters (9% to 58%)    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">54</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">55</xref>], and pigs (6% to 25%) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">83</xref>]. Similarly, variable responsiveness to CLA was observed for epididymal, perirenal, and subcutaneous body fat depots    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">55</xref>]. Inconsistent responses to <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA have been reported in clinical trials with humans [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">84</xref>]. Some have shown significant effects on body composition    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">63</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">85</xref>], while others have not    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">64</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">65</xref>]. The differences in the responses are attributed to differences in the dose levels, age, and rate of adipose tissue TG turnover    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">66</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">84</xref>]. The response to CLA isomers also depends on the physiological state of the animal which is probably due to differences in the preferential uptake of CLA by different tissues. For example, <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA is preferentially taken up by the mammary tissue during lactation leading to substantial (~45%) decrease in milk lipid synthesis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"subsection\" id=\"sec3.2\"><title>3.2. Effects of CLA on Hepatic Lipid Metabolism</title><p>Liver plays an important role in energy homeostasis, as it converts excessive dietary glucose into FA which is exported as TG.  Liver is an important target for CLA effects irrespective of the physiological condition. Of the different CLA isomers, <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA causes increased lipid accumulation leading to hepatic steatosis    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">32</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">86</xref>]. However, the intensity of lipid accumulation varies depending on the level of CLA in the diet, duration of feeding, physiological condition, and animal species (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab1\">Table 1</xref>). The factors leading to hepatic lipid accumulation are multifactorial involving increased FA influx, increased FA synthesis, and altered FA oxidation and TG secretion insufficient to prevent lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">33</xref>]. These mechanisms are probably not mutually exclusive and could act in a coordinated manner to hasten the development and progression of fatty liver [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B46\">87</xref>]. </p><sec sec-type=\"subsubsection\" id=\"sec3.2.1\"><title>3.2.1.  Hepatic FA Synthesis</title><p>  Under normal conditions, <italic>de  novo </italic>lipogenesis contributes minimally to the lipid pool in the liver [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">88</xref>].  However, the lipid synthesis increases to as much as 26% during steatotic conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">89</xref>]. The increase in hepatic lipid content due to CLA, specifically <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA, is commonly associated with increased hepatic lipogenesis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">30</xref>].  In mice, CLA has been repeatedly shown to increase the expression of <italic>sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c)</italic>, key transcriptional regulator in hepatic lipogenesis and its downstream genes <italic>acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and stearoyl CoA  desaturase-1 (SCD1)</italic>    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">34</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">35</xref>] (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab2\">Table 2</xref>).  However, in rats and hamsters, the responses are equivocal.  The increase in <italic>SREBP-1c</italic> expression in mice is attributed to hyperinsulinemia (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">30</xref>]. The decreased expression of lipogenic<italic> (ACC1, ACC2, FASN,</italic> and <italic>SCD1</italic>) genes in the absence of insulin in mice fed <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA further supports this argument [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">33</xref>]. In addition to <italic>SREBP-1c</italic>, insulin induces the expression of <italic>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>  (PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>)</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">90</xref>], which is in low abundance under normal conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">91</xref>]. <italic>PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic></italic> expression is increased in steatotic liver (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1</xref>)    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">92</xref>], while its ablation ameliorates the condition in mice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">93</xref>]. Insulin resistance in response to <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA could upregulate  genes of glucogenic pathway (e.g., <italic>PEPCK, G6P</italic>) leading to hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">94</xref>]. In turn, elevated blood glucose concentrations could upregulate hepatic lipogenesis through <italic>carbohydrate response element binding protein</italic> (<italic>ChREBP)</italic>, a transcriptional regulator modulated by glucose (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1</xref>). The targeted deletion of <italic>ChREBP</italic> in the liver improves the steatotic conditions in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">94</xref>]. However, the role of <italic>ChREBP</italic> in CLA-induced hepatic steatosis is not known. Although hyperinsulinemia triggers the hepatic lipogenesis, CLA-induced hepatic steatosis in the absence of insulin suggests the involvement of other regulatory mechanisms affecting hepatic lipid accumulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"subsubsection\" id=\"sec3.2.2\"><title>3.2.2. Hepatic FA Uptake and TG Secretion</title><p>  In mouse experiments, dietary <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA was associated with upregulation of genes associated with FA uptake and TG secretion <italic>(FAT/CD36</italic>; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab2\">Table 2</xref>). During hepatic steatosis  about 59% of hepatic TG is derived from free FA released from the adipose tissue and 15% is derived from dietary fat [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">89</xref>].

Role of Adipose during CLA-Induced Hepatic Steatosis</title><p>The effect of CLA on adipose lipid metabolism is well documented [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>]. Of all the CLA isomers, <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA is the most potent to induce changes in adipose [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. The changes may be caused by reduced lipid content, size, and number of adipocytes. <italic>Trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA reduces lipogenesis by decreasing expression of <italic>SREBP-1c</italic> and <italic>PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic></italic> and their downstream genes, <italic>ACC</italic>, <italic>FASN</italic>, and <italic>SCD1</italic>, reduces glucose and FA uptake by reducing <italic>GLUT4</italic> and <italic>LPL</italic> expression, increases FA oxidation by increasing <italic>CPT1</italic> and <italic>UCP2</italic> expression and reduces adipocyte proliferation and differentiation by reducing <italic>PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic></italic>and its downstream genes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B95\">131</xref>]. Furthermore, CLA affects various adipocyte secreted-adipokines (e.g., leptin, adiponectin, and resistin) and cytokines (e.g., <italic>TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></italic> and <italic>IL6</italic>), which are involved in wide range of physiological activities [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>]. <italic>Trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA increases the mRNA expression of cytokines, <italic>TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> in adipose tissue [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B95\">131</xref>]. However, the circulating cytokine levels are reduced in response to <italic>trans-</italic>10<italic>, cis-</italic>12 CLA (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab2\">Table 2</xref>). The increased  cytokine expression in adipose tissue is known to reduce the activity of <italic>PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic></italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B96\">132</xref>], and thereby affect its downstream cellular functions. Also, <italic>TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> inhibit the activation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (<italic>IRS-1</italic>) through induction of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS3) disrupting insulin action [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B97\">133</xref>]. The expressions of <italic>TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></italic> and adiponectin, an adipokine associated with insulin sensitivity, are inversely related [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B98\">134</xref>]. The adipose tissue depletion would reduce the level of adiponectin and when coupled with increased <italic>TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></italic> would lead to severe insulin resistance. The subsequent pancreatic <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> cell hyperplasia, as a compensatory mechanism to insulin resistance, leads to hyperinsulinemia which promotes lipid accretion in the liver leading to hepatic steatosis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B99\">39</xref>].  </p><p>In mice, <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA causes severe lipodystrophy reducing the levels of leptin and adiponectin (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab2\">Table 2</xref>), which leads to hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab1\">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1</xref>). Re-establishing the levels of leptin or adiponectin either through external supplementation (in case of leptin) or induction using rosiglitazone (ROSI)  (in case of adiponectin)  attenuated hepatic steatotic condition and normalized the insulin levels in CLA-fed mice    [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B100\">135</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B101\">136</xref>].

The anti-inflammatory role of <italic>cis</italic>-9, <italic>trans</italic>-11 CLA is related to the induction of  anti-inflammatory heat shock protein (HSP) 70&#x02009;kDa and decreased expression of  proinflammatory macrophage migration inhibitory factor [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B120\">147</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"section\" id=\"sec6\"><title>6. Conclusions</title><p>Hepatic steatosis induced by <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA is associated with lipodystrophy in addition to insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia in mice (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1</xref>). These effects are largely attributed to decreased adipokine (leptin and adiponectin) secretion. Dietary interventions preventing lipodystrophy or normalizing leptin and adiponectin levels prevents or ameliorates hepatic steatosis in mice, suggesting that adipose tissue responsiveness to <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA could be the main contributing factor. The moderate responsiveness of adipose tissue to <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA observed in hamsters and rats results in lower (or absence of) hepatic TG accumulation when compared with mice (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab1\">Table 1</xref>) explains species specific responses. </p><p>Hepatic steatosis, due to increased lipid accumulation, is multifactorial and is largely attributed to increased rates of lipid synthesis along with lipid uptake, and it far exceeds the rates of FA oxidation and VLDL secretion. In addition, <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA-induced hepatic steatosis is characterized by reduction of n-6 PUFA (especially C20:4n-6) and n-3 PUFA (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1</xref>). Changes in hepatic FA composition could play an important role in progression of hepatic steatosis, as normalizing the levels of n-6 PUFA or n-3 PUFA by dietary supplementation prevents or ameliorates hepatic lipid accumulation. Further studies are needed to understand the molecular mechanisms and the interrelationship between <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 CLA-induced hepatic steatosis and altered hepatic PUFA content. We are still lacking mechanistic details showing relationship between adipokine levels, insulin resistance, and hepatic FA composition in context of hepatic steatosis, and it needs to be addressed in the future experiments. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>D.
